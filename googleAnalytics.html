<h1>Google Analytics</h1>

<h2>What are analytic tools and in general how do they work?</h2>
<p>Analytic tools are tools that collect, measure, analyze, and report various statistics used to understand and optimize the usage of a website. These statistics are gathered from HTTP requests (a request to the server from the client that includes data like the source IP address, the user agent, referring page, and request method and content).</p>

<h2>What type of information do they provide to the website owner?</h2>
<p>Types of information that analytics provide to the website owner include number of page views, bounce rates (single-page visits), session durations, click paths, exit rates (how many times a page is the last seen in a visit), and location of IP address.</p>
